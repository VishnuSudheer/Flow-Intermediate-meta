This project provides a complete implementation of a Fungible Token contract for the Flow blockchain. It includes:

#Core Contract:

FlowToken contract with owner-controlled minting, individual vaults for balances, and various transactions/scripts for token management.
Emphasis on secure transfer and double-spend prevention.
#Fundamental Transactions and Scripts:

MINT to create new tokens, SETUP to initialize user vaults, and TRANSFER to move tokens between accounts.
READ BALANCE, SETUP VALIDATION, and TOTAL SUPPLY CHECK scripts for information retrieval and verification.
#Enhancements:

Improved SETUP transaction for fixing incorrect vaults.
Flexible READ BALANCE script for non-standard vault setups.
#Key Features:

Resource identifiers and capabilities for secure token identification and validation.
#Advanced Functionality:

Admin-exclusive transaction for withdrawing tokens from user vaults and depositing equivalent $FLOW tokens.
BALANCE SUMMARY and VAULT OVERVIEW scripts for comprehensive user and system token information.
#Swap Contract Integration:

Allows users to exchange $FLOW for custom tokens based on a cooldown period.
Utilizes a custom identity resource and $FLOW vault reference for secure authentication and transactions.
#Conclusion:

This project showcases a well-structured and feature-rich Fungible Token contract for the Flow blockchain, offering clear functionalities and ease of navigation.

#Additionally:

I can provide more detailed information on specific aspects of the project if you have any questions.
I can also offer comparisons with other Fungible Token implementations on Flow or other blockchains.
